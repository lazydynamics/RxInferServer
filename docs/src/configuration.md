# Configuration 

This section describes the configuration options for the RxInferServer.jl package.
`RxInferServer` exposes two different configuration mechanisms:

- Environment variables: for setting runtime settings, which do not require recompilation of the project
- Preferences: for setting preferences persistent across Julia sessions, which are usually compile-time settings, changes in these settings require recompilation of the project

## Environment Variables

This section describes the environment variables that can be set to configure the server.

#### Port Configuration

The server port can be configured using the `RXINFER_SERVER_PORT` environment variable:

```julia
# Set port via environment variable
ENV["RXINFER_SERVER_PORT"] = 9000
RxInferServer.serve()
```

#### CORS Configuration

The server supports CORS configuration. The following environment variables can be set to configure the CORS settings:

- `RXINFER_SERVER_CORS_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_ORIGIN`: The allowed origins for CORS requests.
- `RXINFER_SERVER_CORS_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_METHODS`: The allowed methods for CORS requests.
- `RXINFER_SERVER_CORS_ACCESS_CONTROL_ALLOW_HEADERS`: The allowed headers for CORS requests.

#### Authentication Configuration

The server implements standard Bearer token authentication using the HTTP `Authorization` header. All endpoints except `/token` require authentication by default.

Authentication for development can be configured through the `RXINFER_SERVER_DEV_TOKEN` environment variable:

- Default value: `dev-token` (allows authentication with this value during development)
- Special values:
  - `disabled`: Disables the development token, requiring proper production tokens for all authentication
  
```julia
# Use a specific development token
ENV["RXINFER_SERVER_DEV_TOKEN"] = "my-custom-token"

# Disable development token (production mode)
ENV["RXINFER_SERVER_DEV_TOKEN"] = "disabled"
```

When implementing client applications, you must include the token in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
```

For development and testing, you can use the configured development token (default is `dev-token`):

```
Authorization: Bearer dev-token
```

```@docs
RxInferServer.is_dev_token_enabled
RxInferServer.is_dev_token_disabled
RxInferServer.is_dev_token
```

!!! note
    In production environments, you should set `RXINFER_SERVER_DEV_TOKEN=disabled` and implement proper token validation logic.

#### Server Edition

The server edition can be configured using the `RXINFER_SERVER_EDITION` environment variable:

```julia
ENV["RXINFER_SERVER_EDITION"] = "CommunityEdition"
```

This setting has no real effect on the server functionality, and is only used to identify the server edition.

## Preferences 

This section describes the preferences that can be set to configure the server. These settings persist across Julia sessions and require a restart of the server to take effect. You could also manually modify the `LocalPreferences.toml` file to change these settings.

#### Hot Reloading

The server supports hot reloading, which automatically updates endpoints when code changes are detected. This feature is enabled by default but can be disabled:

```julia
# Check current setting
RxInferServer.is_hot_reload_enabled()  # Returns true by default

# Disable hot reloading
RxInferServer.set_hot_reload(false)

# Enable hot reloading
RxInferServer.set_hot_reload(true)
```

```@docs
RxInferServer.is_hot_reload_enabled
RxInferServer.set_hot_reload
```
