    description: |
      Learned priors for missing feature vectors. This is a dictionary mapping 
      data point indices (as strings) to prior distributions (mean and covariance).
     

data:
  - name: x
    description: |
      Input features for feature discovery.
      This should be an array of numbers. 
      For example, if you have D features, `x` should be an array of D numbers.
    type: array
    required: true
  - name: y
    description: |
      Target values (dependent variables) for the feature discovery regression.
      This is the output variable that the model will attempt to predict
      based on the input features `x` using Bayesian regression. Can be omitted
      if the model is used for inference only.
    type: number
    required: false
