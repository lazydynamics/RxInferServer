name: BlackBoxStateSpaceModel-v1
description: |
  This model represents a linear Guassian dynamical system with unknown dynamics.
  The state transition is modeled as a matrix with Gaussian prior on the elements.
  The observational model is assumed to be the diagonal matrix with `1` on the diagonal.
