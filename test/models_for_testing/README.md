# Test Model Zoo

This folder contains model implementations used for testing purposes. These models are designed to validate the functionality of the RxInfer server and client interactions. They simulate various inference scenarios with different complexity levels. Each model in this directory is structured according to the standard model format, including configuration files and implementation code, but they are specifically crafted to exercise test cases rather than for production use.

For detailed information about the standard model format and how to create your own models, please refer to the [How to Add a Model](@ref manual-how-to-add-a-model) manual.
